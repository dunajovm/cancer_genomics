# Variant calling
The goal of this exercise is to create a simple variant calling workflow for human sequencing data.
Please describe the steps of your workflow using markdown (GitHub Markdown).
The workflow should contain steps to align the FASTQ files to the human reference genome (bwa), 
call variants (bcftools) and annotate all single-nucleotide variants with (VEP). 


For this excercise you can ignore all InDels. 
Once you have finished the exercise, send me the repository URL of your GitHub repository 
and the likely causative variant via email.
