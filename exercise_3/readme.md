# Working with count matrices

In this exercise we want to run a differential gene expression analysis using an RNA-Seq count matrix. 

Starting from an Rscript template please run a differential expression analysis, generate PCA,
Heatmap and MA-plots and export the results into a CSV file. 

Once you are done please upload your Rscript to your GitHub repository and email me again the repository link, thanks!


**Optional**: You may also want to run a gene set enrichment analysis on the differentially expressed genes.
